> Spec: AI Logo Generation Workflow
> Created: 2025-07-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement an AI-powered logo generation workflow that analyzes business plans and automatically creates professional logos for Laravel applications. This feature will dramatically reduce the time needed to create branded assets from hours to minutes.

## User Stories

### Developer Logo Creation

As a developer starting a new project, I want to generate a professional logo based on my business plan, so that I can quickly establish a visual identity without hiring a designer.

The developer runs `php artisan logo:generate --name="MyApp"` and the system analyzes their Agent OS mission file, extracts the current theme colors, generates multiple logo options using AI, presents them in a preview interface, and saves the selected logo in all required formats.

### Business Context Integration

As a developer using Agent OS, I want the logo generator to understand my business context from the mission file, so that the generated logos are relevant and appropriate for my industry and target audience.

The system parses the `.agent-os/product/mission.md` file to extract industry, target audience, brand personality, and values, then combines this with the current theme colors from the configuration to create contextually appropriate AI prompts.

### Logo Selection and Management

As a developer reviewing generated logos, I want to see how logos look in different contexts, so that I can choose one that works well across all use cases.

The preview interface shows logos in various sizes and contexts (app icon, header, loading screen, social media), allows easy selection, and provides options to generate additional variations if needed.

## Spec Scope

1. **Artisan Command** - Create `logo:generate` command with options for app name, style override, and color override
2. **Agent OS Mission Parser** - Extract business attributes from `.agent-os/product/mission.md` and theme configuration
3. **AI Service Integration** - Implement service to generate logos via Prism PHP with support for multiple providers
4. **Preview Interface** - Web-based UI for reviewing and selecting from generated logo options
5. **Asset Processing** - Convert selected logos to SVG and generate all required formats and sizes

## Out of Scope

- Manual logo editing or customization tools
- Integration with design software like Adobe Creative Suite
- Support for animated logos or complex brand systems
- Generation of full brand guidelines beyond basic logo assets
- Multi-language support for business plan parsing

## Expected Deliverable

1. Running `php artisan logo:generate` successfully generates 6-8 logo options based on business context
2. Preview interface at `/logo-preview/{session_id}` displays all generated options with real-world previews
3. Selected logos are saved in SVG format with automatic generation of favicon, Apple touch icon, and PNG variants in multiple sizes
