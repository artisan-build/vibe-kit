## 2025-01-24: Initial Product Planning - AI-First Laravel Starter Kit

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team

### Decision

Create an opinionated Laravel 12+ starter kit optimized for AI-assisted development with Agent OS integration. The starter kit targets developers who want to leverage AI tools like Claude Code to build modern web applications faster while maintaining high code quality.

### Context

Laravel's new starter kit concept in version 12 provides an opportunity to create a highly specialized template. With the rise of AI coding assistants, there's a need for project structures and tooling specifically designed to work well with AI agents. This starter kit addresses that gap by combining modern Laravel practices with AI-first development workflows.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Generic Laravel Starter**
   - Pros: Broader appeal, simpler maintenance
   - Cons: Misses AI optimization opportunity, less differentiated

2. **Framework-Agnostic AI Toolkit**
   - Pros: Wider audience, language independent
   - Cons: Less integrated, can't leverage Laravel-specific patterns

3. **Extension to Existing Starter (Jetstream/Breeze)**
   - Pros: Less work, proven base
   - Cons: Limited customization, can't optimize structure for AI

### Rationale

Building a purpose-built starter kit allows us to make opinionated choices that specifically benefit AI-assisted development while providing a production-ready foundation that reflects our actual development practices.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- 10x faster development with AI agents
- Consistent code quality across AI-generated features
- Reduced setup time for new projects
- Clear differentiation in the Laravel ecosystem

**Negative:**
- Narrower target audience (AI-first developers)
- Maintenance burden of staying current with AI tool changes
- Opinionated choices may not suit all teams

## 2025-01-24: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Adopt TALL stack (TailwindCSS, Alpine.js, Laravel, Livewire) with FilamentPHP 4 (beta) for admin, Flux Pro for UI components, and SQLite as default database. Use strict quality standards with PHPStan Level 6, Laravel Pint, and PestPHP.

### Context

The starter kit needs a modern, productive stack that works well with AI code generation. The chosen technologies need to be well-documented, have strong Laravel integration, and produce predictable patterns that AI can learn and replicate.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Inertia.js + Vue/React**
   - Pros: Modern SPA experience, popular frameworks
   - Cons: More complex for AI, requires more boilerplate

2. **Traditional Blade + jQuery**
   - Pros: Simple, well-understood
   - Cons: Dated approach, poor developer experience

3. **API-only + Separate Frontend**
   - Pros: Maximum flexibility, modern architecture
   - Cons: More complex setup, harder AI coordination

### Rationale

The TALL stack provides the best balance of modern capabilities and AI-friendliness. Livewire's component model is predictable for AI, while FilamentPHP provides rapid admin development. Flux Pro's consistent component library helps AI generate uniform UIs.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Highly productive development stack
- Consistent patterns for AI to follow
- Rich ecosystem of compatible packages
- Single language (PHP) reduces context switching

**Negative:**
- Beta dependency (FilamentPHP 4) requires careful monitoring
- Flux Pro is a paid component (but worth it)
- SQLite may need replacement for some use cases

## 2025-01-24: Agent OS as Core Development Methodology

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

Make Agent OS the primary development methodology for the starter kit, with all tooling and structure optimized for Agent OS workflows. This includes comprehensive AI instructions, spec-driven development, and automated task execution patterns.

### Context

Traditional development workflows don't maximize the potential of AI assistants. Agent OS provides a structured approach to AI-assisted development that ensures consistency, quality, and speed. By building the starter kit around Agent OS from the ground up, we can create an optimal environment for AI-first development.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Basic AI Instructions Only**
   - Pros: Simpler, less opinionated
   - Cons: Misses workflow optimization, inconsistent results

2. **Multiple AI Tool Support**
   - Pros: Flexibility for different tools
   - Cons: Complexity, harder to optimize deeply

3. **Custom AI Framework**
   - Pros: Full control
   - Cons: Massive effort, reinventing the wheel

### Rationale

Agent OS provides a proven methodology for AI-assisted development. By going all-in on Agent OS, we can provide the best possible experience for developers using Claude Code and similar AI tools.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Optimal AI development workflow out of the box
- Consistent patterns across all projects using the starter
- Reduced learning curve for Agent OS adoption
- Strong differentiation from other starters

**Negative:**
- Tighter coupling to Agent OS methodology
- May not suit teams with different AI workflows
- Requires maintaining Agent OS compatibility

## 2025-01-24: Local Development First

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Development Team

### Decision

Optimize the starter kit for local development with Laravel Herd Pro, using SQLite as the default database and providing comprehensive local development scripts.

### Context

Modern local development tools like Laravel Herd Pro provide excellent development experience without the complexity of Docker or Vagrant. SQLite offers a zero-configuration database that's perfect for development and many production use cases.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Docker-based Development**
   - Pros: Consistent environments, production-like
   - Cons: Complex, resource heavy, slower

2. **Vagrant/Homestead**
   - Pros: Laravel official, well-documented
   - Cons: Heavy, outdated approach

3. **Cloud Development Environments**
   - Pros: No local setup, consistent
   - Cons: Requires internet, can be slow, costs

### Rationale

Local-first development with modern tools provides the best developer experience. Laravel Herd Pro with SQLite offers instant setup and fast iteration cycles that are perfect for AI-assisted development.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Zero to running in under 5 minutes
- Fast iteration cycles for AI development
- No external dependencies for getting started
- Works offline

**Negative:**
- May differ from production environment
- SQLite limitations for some use cases
- Requires Laravel Herd Pro for optimal experience
