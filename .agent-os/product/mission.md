## Pitch

Vibe is an opinionated Laravel 12+ starter kit that helps developers rapidly build modern web applications by providing a pre-configured TALL stack with AI-first development workflows, enabling teams to ship production-ready applications in days instead of weeks.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Solo Developers**: Independent developers building SaaS products who want a battle-tested foundation
- **Development Agencies**: Teams building multiple client projects who need consistent, high-quality starting points
- **AI-Assisted Development Teams**: Developers leveraging AI tools like Claude Code who need AI-optimized project structures

### User Personas

**Tech-Savvy Founder** (25-45 years old)
- **Role:** Technical Founder / Solo Developer
- **Context:** Building a new SaaS product with limited resources
- **Pain Points:** Time spent on boilerplate setup, inconsistent code quality when using AI assistants
- **Goals:** Launch MVP quickly, maintain high code quality, leverage AI for faster development

**Agency Developer** (22-35 years old)
- **Role:** Full-Stack Developer at Digital Agency
- **Context:** Managing multiple client projects with tight deadlines
- **Pain Points:** Repeating setup work for each project, onboarding new team members
- **Goals:** Standardize project setup, reduce time to first feature, ensure consistent quality

## The Problem

### Repetitive Laravel Setup

Developers waste days setting up authentication, admin panels, testing frameworks, and coding standards for every new Laravel project. This setup time delays actual feature development and often results in inconsistent configurations across projects.

**Our Solution:** Pre-configured Laravel 12+ starter with authentication, admin panel, testing, and quality tools ready to use.

### AI Development Friction

AI coding assistants often generate inconsistent code styles and miss project-specific patterns. Without proper context and standards, AI-generated code requires significant manual cleanup.

**Our Solution:** Agent OS integration with comprehensive AI instructions ensuring consistent, high-quality AI-generated code.

### Modern Stack Integration

Integrating modern tools like Livewire, FilamentPHP, and Flux UI requires expertise and time. Developers often struggle with version compatibility and optimal configuration.

**Our Solution:** Pre-integrated TALL stack with FilamentPHP 4 and Flux Pro UI, tested and optimized for production use.

## Differentiators

### AI-First Development

Unlike traditional starter kits, we provide deep Agent OS integration with comprehensive instructions for AI assistants. This results in 10x faster feature development with consistent code quality.

### Opinionated Excellence

Unlike flexible boilerplates, we make deliberate choices (SQLite, Flux Pro, FilamentPHP 4) based on real-world usage. This results in faster decision-making and proven architectural patterns.

### Quality Automation

Unlike basic starters, we include PHPStan, Pint, Rector, and PestPHP pre-configured with strict standards. This results in maintainable code from day one with automated quality checks.
