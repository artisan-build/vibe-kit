# Vibe by Artisan Build

Vibe is a set of tools and commands to put guardrails around LLM coding agents, allowing them to 
work through large task lists unsupervised. 

## Creating a Task List

We use [Kiro](#) to turn our ideas into PRDs, TDDs, and robust task lists optimized for LLM agent development. While
this isn't a requirement, the default location of the supporting documentation is guided by how Kiro sets things up.
So if you're going to create your documentation and task list some other way, you will need to either modfiy the
configuration of this package or ensure that the resulting documentation and task list are stored in the expected 
location.

## Agents Supported

[Gemini](#) Google's Gemini CLI offers a generous free plan to individual composers who sign up using a personal gmail account.
